# Project Description

Conda Vendor is a tool to create local conda channels and manifests based on an input conda environment yaml file. This tool is particularly useful when trying to use conda packages inside an air-gapped network.

The tool works by intaking a [conda environment yaml file](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually) and performing a conda solve to determine what packages are needed.  Conda vendor will download those packages and provide `repodata.json`
files for the relevant directories, so that the downloaded files are a
valid conda channel.

## Usage

#### Creating a Local Channel
The most basic way to use `conda-vendor` is to just pass an `environment.yaml`
file to the `vendor` subcommand
```bash
$ conda-vendor vendor --file my_environment.yaml
```

This will solve the environment specified in `my_environment.yaml` using the
host platform.  Sometimes it is necessary or desirable to solve for another
platform.  The `vendor` command allows this with the `--platform` flag.  The usage looks like
```bash
$ conda-vendor vendor --file my_environment.yaml  --platform linux-64
```

By default `conda-vendor` will use a set of *virtual packages* for the specified
platform. [If no platform is supplied it will use the host platform as if it were supplied explicitly, and thus the *virtual packages* might not be correct
for the host.]  These packages can be overwritten by providing a yaml files
specifying the desired *virtual packages* using the `--virtual-package-spec`
option:
```bash
$ conda-vendor vendor --file my_environment.yaml  \
                      --platform linux-64 \
                      --virtual-package-spec my_virtual_packages.yaml
```

The `conda-vendor vendor` command also has an option `--dry-run` to allow
solving the environment without downloading files.  It outputs a json formatted
block of text describing all the files that would be downloaded in the
local channel.

#### Using the Local channel

There are several ways to use the local channel. If python was in the input `environment.yaml` file for example, the following could be used:

	conda create -n test_env python -c <path_to_local_channel> --offline

The `--offline` flag will prevent conda from reaching out to the internet for packages. To verify that the environment created only contains packages contained in the local channel, run the following:

	conda activate test_env
	conda list --explicit

This should show a list of all the packages in the environment the local paths to their source code (typically tar.bz2 files).


## Creating a Custom Manifest for Package Security Validation

The following functionality is only applicable if there is an organization that requires a list of packages for security validation. Currently the Iron Bank format is supported, but support for other formats can potentially be added
in the future.

To generate an iron bank manifest from the `environment.yaml`, use
the `ironbank-gen` subcommand:

```bash
$ conda-vendor ironbank_gen --file my_environment.yaml ....
```
This will output a manifest file in the Iron Bank required format.  This can
also be accomplished as part of the local channel creation by passing
the flag `--ironbank-gen` to the `vendor` subcommand:
```bash
$ conda-vendor ...vendor arguments... --ironbank_gen
```
